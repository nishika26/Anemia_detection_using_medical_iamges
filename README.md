# Anemia_detection_using_medical_iamges

In this project I have used 5 different models to detect the Anemia from the images using Conjuctiva Images. I have used CNN , XGBoost Classifier , Logistic Regression. The other 2 models are made from transfer learning models :- VGG16, ResNet50

The dataset used for this project is:- 
Appiahene P, Asare JW, Donkoh E. Application of machine learning in detecting iron deficiency anemia using conjunctiva image dataset from Ghana. Mendeley Data. 2022;V1. doi:https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/nt7r8hv2pz/1
