## Project Overview

In this project I have used 5 different models to detect the Anemia from the images using Conjuctiva Images. I have used CNN , XGBoost Classifier , Logistic Regression. The other 2 models are made from transfer learning models :- VGG16, ResNet50

The dataset used for this project is:-

This project aims to detect anemia using images of the conjunctiva (the mucous membrane that covers the front of the eye and lines the inside of the eyelids). Anemia is a condition where there is a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, leading to fatigue, weakness, and other health issues. Early detection is crucial for timely treatment and management.

In this project, I utilized five different models to detect anemia from conjunctiva images. These models include:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
XGBoost Classifier
Logistic Regression
VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)
Models Used
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A deep learning model specifically designed for image classification tasks. The CNN model is trained to learn features from conjunctiva images that are indicative of anemia.

2. XGBoost Classifier
An ensemble learning method based on gradient boosting. The XGBoost classifier is trained on features extracted from the images to predict the presence of anemia.

3. Logistic Regression
A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. In this project, logistic regression is used as a baseline model to classify images as anemic or non-anemic.

4. VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model pre-trained on ImageNet. Transfer learning allows us to leverage the learned features from VGG16 and fine-tune the model for the specific task of anemia detection.

5. ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)
ResNet50 is another pre-trained CNN model known for its deep residual learning capabilities. Like VGG16, we fine-tune ResNet50 for our specific classification task.
